# Contributing to phsyrisk-api

## Getting started

To get set up, clone and enter the repo.

    git clone git@github.com:os-climate/physrisk-api.git
    cd physrisk-api

We recommend using [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) for a
consistent working environment.

    pip install pipenv
    pipenv install
    pipenv shell

When adding a package for use in new or improved functionality,
`pipenv install <package-name>`. Or, when adding something helpful for
testing or development, `pipenv install -d <package-name>`.

## Development

Patches may be contributed via pull requests to
<https://github.com/os-climate/physrisk-api>.

All changes must pass the automated test suite, along with various static
checks.

[Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) code style and
[isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) import ordering are enforced
and enabling automatic formatting via [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
is recommended:

    pre-commit install

This will ensure changes meet common best practice.

E.g.,

    # auto-sort imports
    isort .
    # auto-format code
    black .

Code can then be tested using tox.

### run static checks and unit tests

    tox

### run only tests

    tox -e py3

### run only static checks

    tox -e static

### run unit tests and produce an HTML code coverage report (/htmlcov)

    tox -e cov

To run the application locally, run either of the following commands;

    docker-compose up
    # or
    podman-compose up

One may then make requests of <https://0.0.0.0:8080>.

## Releasing

Currently, this service is released automatically to quay.io and manually
deployed onto OpenShift.

## Debugging Flask (without Docker)

The Flask app itself can be run via:

```
cd src/physrisk_api
flask run
```

For VS Code users, the launch.json configuration suitable for debugging is:

```json
{
  "name": "Python: Flask",
  "type": "python",
  "request": "launch",
  "module": "flask",
  "env": {
    "FLASK_APP": "src/physrisk_api/app.py",
    "FLASK_ENV": "development",
    "FLASK_DEBUG": "1"
  },
  "args": ["run", "--no-debugger", "--no-reload"],
  "jinja": true,
  "justMyCode": false
}
```
